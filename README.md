# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hey there, I'm João Pedro Silva!<br><br>🌟 About Me<br><br>🧑‍💻 I'm a passionate tech enthusiast who's been on a journey of self-improvement and continuous learning in the world of programming and design. Over the past year, I've been on a mission to master both UI/UX design and FullStack Development, and I've made some significant strides in achieving that goal.<br><br>🎨 At the [Lisbon School of Design](https://www.lsd.pt/), I honed my design skills and immersed myself in the fascinating world of User Interface and User Experience design. It's been an incredible adventure, learning how to craft visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that captivate and engage users.<br><br>💻 In parallel, I embarked on a coding adventure at [EDIT Porto](https://weareedit.io/), where I delved into the realm of FullStack Development. I've mastered the art of web development, and my toolbox now includes skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Currently, I'm taking my skills to the next level by diving into Next.js, an exciting framework for building modern web applications.<br><br>🚀 Fun Fact<br><br>🕹️ My journey into the world of coding began with a simple line of code in a ROBLOX script way back in 2009. Little did I know that this small step would lead to a new passion for technology and programming 13 years later.<br><br>🌐 Connect with Me<br><br>If you share my love for technology, design, and coding, let's connect!
