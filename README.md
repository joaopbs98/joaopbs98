### About Me

I made a conscious decision to leave a stable career and pursue frontend development full-time.  
What started as an internship turned into a deeper focus on product-building, systems thinking, and long-term skill growth.

Background includes:

- Project management experience in e-commerce and digital operations  
- Full-stack development certification + deep self-study  
- Frontend specialization in React, TypeScript, and Next.js  
- UI/UX design training to support frontend decision-making  
- Current work includes web apps, internal tools, and agency builds

---

### Current Stack

- **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, SQL  
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, GSAP  
- **Backend (learning):** Supabase, PostgreSQL, Node.js  
- **Design Tools:** Figma, Designing Interfaces (Hype4), The Designership

---

### Focus Areas

- Building maintainable frontend architectures  
- Component design systems  
- Web performance & accessibility  
- Developer experience (DX) and workflow automation  
- Full product development from idea to deployment

---

### In Progress

I’m currently prioritizing finishing and refining personal projects that reflect my thinking, not just tutorials.  
Expect to see:

- Production-ready React/Next.js apps  
- Tailored UI systems with Figma + code parity  
- Small SaaS experiments  
- Frontend utilities and internal tools
